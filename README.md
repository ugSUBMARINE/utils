`grid.py` can be used to extract the values from a heatmap, which is only available as an image, and then output them as an available numpy array. This data can then be stored in a tsv file. Required inputs are the filepath, the number of rectangles in the heatmap - both in x and y direction and the orientation of the colorbar of the heatmap.
